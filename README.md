# LLM Wiki — Personal Knowledge Base

# Background

This repo is a personal LLM-maintained wiki inspired by 
[Andrej Karpathy's llm-wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) 
and [SamurAIGPT](https://github.com/SamurAIGPT/llm-wiki-agent).

The core problem it solves: linking knowledge across research 
papers and personal notes, with an LLM handling all the 
bookkeeping — extracting concepts, building wikilinks, and 
detecting gaps automatically.

Each project or knowledge domain should have its own separate 
wiki instance. The pipeline processes markdown files only, 
keeping token usage low and making all content readable in 
Obsidian.

> **Note**: This repo processes markdown files only to save 
> tokens and keep content readable for Gemini CLI.

## How It Works

There are two layers:

- **Python pipeline** (`main.py` + `1_tools/`) — handles batch operations: ingesting files, building the knowledge graph, linting for issues, querying for answers.
- **Gemini CLI** (`GEMINI.md`) — an interactive conversational layer. Open the repo with `gemini` for multi-turn queries, follow-up questions, and exploration. The file `WIKI_STATUS.md` acts as the handoff state between the two layers.

```

## Setup

### 1. Install uv and create environment

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
```

### 2. Configure `.env`

```
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
LLM_MODEL="gemini-2.0-flash"
```

---

## Note Templates

Use the right template when writing your source notes in Obsidian or any markdown editor:

- **Academic paper notes** → `10_System/Templates/Paper Summary Template.md`
- **Personal knowledge notes** → `10_System/Templates/Default Property Template.md`

The ingest pipeline auto-detects which type of note it's reading and applies the appropriate processing.

---

## Commands

### Ingest

Processes source documents, extracts entities and concepts, and updates the wiki.

```bash
# Ingest a single note
uv run main.py ingest 20_raw/20.2_notes/my-note.md

# Ingest a PDF paper
uv run main.py ingest 20_raw/20.3_pdf/paper.pdf

# Ingest an entire folder
uv run main.py ingest 20_raw/20.2_notes/

# Validate wiki integrity only (no ingest)
uv run main.py ingest --validate-only
```

## Gap Analysis
```bash
# Run semantic gap analysis (terminal output)
uv run main.py gap

# Run and save report to 2_graph/gap-report.md
uv run main.py gap --save

# Rebuild from wiki pages instead of graph.json
uv run main.py gap --rebuild
```
Finds underconnected topic clusters in your research using 
local graph algorithms — no external API required. Run after 
`graph` for best results.

### Query

Ask questions about your knowledge base and get synthesized answers with citations.

```bash
# Print answer to terminal
uv run main.py query "what do I know about transformers?"

# Save answer to wiki/syntheses/
uv run main.py query "what connects my signal processing papers?" --save

# Save to a specific path
uv run main.py query "methodology gaps?" --save 30_wiki/syntheses/methodology-gaps.md
```

For interactive multi-turn querying, use Gemini CLI instead (see below).

### Graph

Builds a visual knowledge graph from all `[[wikilinks]]` in the wiki.

```bash
# Build graph.json and graph.html
uv run main.py graph

# Build and open in browser
uv run main.py graph --open

# Skip semantic inference (faster, wikilinks only)
uv run main.py graph --no-infer
```

Run this after every batch ingest to keep the graph current.

### Lint

Checks the wiki for structural and semantic issues.

```bash
# Print report to terminal
uv run main.py lint

# Save report to 30_wiki/lint-report.md
uv run main.py lint --save
```

Checks for: orphan pages, broken `[[wikilinks]]`, missing entity pages, referenced papers not yet ingested, contradictions between pages, data gaps, hub stubs, and fragile bridges between knowledge clusters.

### Refresh

Re-ingests source files that have changed since the last run.

```bash
# Re-ingest only changed sources
uv run main.py refresh

# Force re-ingest everything
uv run main.py refresh --force

# Refresh a specific page
uv run main.py refresh --page sources/papers/my-paper

# Preview what would be refreshed
uv run main.py refresh --dry-run
```

### Heal

Auto-generates missing entity pages for terms mentioned 3+ times across the wiki but with no dedicated page.

```bash
uv run main.py heal
```

## Gemini CLI (Interactive Exploration)

```bash
cd /path/to/wiki-llm-knowledge
gemini
```

Inside Gemini CLI you can use plain English or shorthand triggers:

```
# Query the wiki
query: what do I know about biosignal processing?
query: what connects my latest papers?

# Check wiki health
lint

# Build the knowledge graph
build graph

# Ingest a new source
ingest 20_raw/20.2_notes/new-note.md

# Check what the Python pipeline last did
read WIKI_STATUS.md and tell me what was last done
```

---

# Recommended Workflow

## After every batch of new papers
```bash
# 1. Ingest new notes
uv run main.py ingest 20_raw/papers/my_notes/
uv run main.py ingest 20_raw/my_knowledge_notes/

# 2. Rebuild knowledge graph
uv run main.py graph

# 3. Check wiki health
uv run main.py lint

# 4. Fix missing entity pages (run after lint reports 5+ missing)
uv run main.py heal
```

## Every 10 papers ingested
```bash
# Detect research gaps
uv run main.py gap

# Save all reports for Obsidian review
uv run main.py graph --report --save
uv run main.py lint --save
uv run main.py gap --save
```

## When you edit an existing raw file
```bash
# Re-ingest only changed files
uv run main.py refresh

# Preview what would change without re-ingesting
uv run main.py refresh --dry-run
```

## Interactive exploration (Gemini CLI)
```bash
cd /path/to/wiki-llm-knowledge
gemini
```

## Paper Ingestion with NotebookLM

For extracting paper summaries, use NotebookLM with the 
provided prompt to generate markdown following 
`10_System/Templates/Paper_Summary_Template.md`.

1. Upload your PDF to NotebookLM
2. Run the extraction prompt (see `10_System/Templates/NotebookLM_Prompt.md`) or use my suggert prompt:
### paper_prompt
```
You are a research assistant helping me summarize academic papers 
into structured markdown notes. I am a researcher in biosignal processing.

Extract information from this paper and return ONLY a markdown note 
using EXACTLY this format — no extra text, no preamble:

---
Title: <paper title>
Authors: <lastname1, lastname2, ...>
Year: <year>
Source: <journal or conference name>
tags:
---

## Core Contribution
One sentence: what specific problem does this paper solve and 
what is the key novelty?

## Key Methodology (Important)
Focus heavily on this section. For each method or technique, include:
